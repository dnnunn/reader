		text: "Human flourishing in the broad sense used here is something that I believe most people can sign up to. It does not commit us to a particular way of life or require the adoption of a particular ethical position. It does not prevent us from using other ethical theories, including deontology  and utilitarianism , to assess ethical questions (Bynum 2006). It is compatible with various theoretical positions beyond the three (critical theory , capability theory , RRI) introduced here. The choice of human flourishing was guided by the need to find an ethical language that can find traction across disciplinary, national, cultural and other boundaries. AI technologies are global and pervasive, but they have an impact at the local and individual level. An approach to the ethics  of AI that aims to provide general guidance therefore needs to be able to build bridges across these many global divides, which I hope the idea of flourishing does.",

This is knowledge of how to organise the processes that are required to deal with ethical questions. For instance, if discrimination  possibilities are to be reduced to increase human flourishing, the governance  options to achieve this need to be known, from legal solutions to technical solutions.\n\nProcedural knowledge should also cover other aspects of reflecting on and evaluating science and technology. Drawing on the discourse on responsible research and innovation , one can identify some important processes that may contribute to ensuring that ethical issues  can be recognised and dealt with. These include anticipation, engagement, reflexivity and responsiveness (Stilgoe et al. 2013).\n\nProcesses of anticipation are required for a structured way of thinking about possible future states that will inform the way in which we act today and prepare for the future. These processes should not be misinterpreted as simple predictions that try to guess what the future will look like. Accurate predictions are notoriously difficult, if not impossible, and the literature is littered with predictions that have turned out to be wrong and in hindsight tend to look ridiculous, such as the prediction by the president of IBM in 1943 that there would be a world market for maybe five computers, or the statement by the chairman of Digital Equipment Corporation in 1977 that there was no reason for anyone to want a computer in their home (Himanen 2001: 187). Processes of anticipation are based on the recognition of the impossibility of prediction. They nevertheless aim to explore possible futures, to help societies decide which actions to take today (Cuhls 2003). There are well-established discourses and academic disciplines that have developed methods for future and foresight studies (Sardar 2010), some of which explicitly focus on the ethical issues  of emerging technologies (Brey 2011, Floridi and Strait 2020). For instance, Flick et al. (2020) explore a wide range of resources, including academic publications, but also social media discussions, to identify expected technical developments in the field of ICT for ageing and ethical concerns that may arise from these. This type of work opens up spaces of possibilities without committing itself to one particular outcome. It is useful in raising awareness and sensitivity to both technical and social or ethical developments and therefore offers the likelihood that these can be shaped appropriately. This type of work can benefit AI ecosystems , but for this to happen, the knowledge of how to undertake anticipatory work needs to be available within the ecosystem.\n\nOne of the processes with the potential to draw knowledge into the AI ethics  ecosystem  is the engagement of all stakeholders. \"Engagement\" refers to activities that bring together different stakeholders in an open manner for a mutually informative exchange of ideas. The importance of engagement in science, research and technology development is long established (Arnstein 1969, Hart et al. 2009, Bickerstaff et al. 2010, Van Est 2011, Boulton et al. 2012). Certain aspects of engagement are also well established in technical disciplines, for example in the form of user engagement or user experience research, which form part of computer science, the parent discipline of AI (Haenlein and Kaplan 2019). However, in order to undertake engagement activities in a way that is ethically sensitive and can contribute to an AI ecosystem  so as to promote human flourishing, they need to be employed carefully. Engagement in science and technology development is sometimes limited to exercises for the public understanding of science, which aim to inform the public about scientific insights or technical achievements. There is nothing wrong with such exercises, but they are only one part of public engagement, which, in order to live up to ethical expectations, needs to facilitate and open two-way communication, with researchers and other stakeholders being willing to engage, listen and respond to each other and take positions seriously. If this is not done in an inclusive manner, important knowledge to be gained about the AI ethics  ecosystem  might be lost.\n\nWhile such an open engagement process promises both better understanding of the ecosystem  through a broadening of the knowledge base and higher levels of acceptability of the resulting research and technologies, there is no guarantee that these will be achieved. Public debates about science, research and technology in many other areas, such as genetically modified organisms, nuclear energy and nanotechnology, show that engagement activities can be highly charged and conflictual (Van Est 2011). The potential for fundamental disagreements on underlying values, aims or desired outcomes pervades all such stakeholder engagements , whether high-profile at a national or international level or conducted at a local or organisational level.",
